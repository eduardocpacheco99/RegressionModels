## Executive Summary

we will examine the mtcars data set and explore how miles per gallon (MPG) is affected by different variables. In particularly, we will answer the following two questions: 
1. Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG, and
2. Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions.

From our analysis we can show that manual transmission has an MPG 1.8 greater than an automatic transmission.

# Exploratory Data ANalysis

First have a look on the first three lines of the data “mtcars”, described in this link ( https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html) and its structure:

```{r}
library(ggplot2) #for plots
data(mtcars)
head(mtcars)
```
